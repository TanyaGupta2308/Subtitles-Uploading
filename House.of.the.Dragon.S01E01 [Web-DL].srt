1
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:08,344
As the first century
of the Targaryen dynasty

2
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:09,864
came to a close
3
7.1
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:14,344
the health of the Old King,
Jaehaerys, was failing.

4
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:21,264
In those days, House Targaryen
stood at the height of its strength

5
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:24,144
with ten adult dragons
under its yoke.

6
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,424
No power in the world
could stand against it.

7
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,224
King Jaehaerys
reigned over nearly 60 years

8
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:33,144
of peace and prosperity

9
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:36,224
but tragedy had claimed
both his sons

10
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,384
leaving his succession in doubt.

11
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:41,344
So, in the year 101

12
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:45,264
the Old King called a Great Council
to choose an heir.

13
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:49,864
Over a thousand lords
made the journey to Harrenhal.

14
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,944
Fourteen succession claims were heard

15
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:57,104
but only two were truly considered.

16
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:01,744
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,
the King's eldest descendant

17
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:05,344
and her younger cousin,
Prince Viserys Targaryen

18
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:08,064
the King's eldest male descendant.

19
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,944
It is declared by all lords paramount

20
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:22,184
and lords vassal
of the Seven Kingdoms

21
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:29,544
that Prince Viserys Targaryen
be made Prince of Dragons tone!

22
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:34,904
Rhaenys, a woman,
would not inherit the Iron Throne.

23
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,664
The lords instead chose Viserys

24
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,624
my father.

25
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,784
Jaehaerys called the Great Council

26
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:51,104
to prevent a war being fought
over his succession.

27
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,384
For he knew the cold truth.

28
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:57,824
The only thing that could tear down
the House of the Dragon

29
00:01:58,344 --> 00:01:59,584
was itself.

30
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:39,941
Subtitle Sync by: Aren Zo

31
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,344
Dohaeras, Syrax!

32
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,023
Umbas.

33
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:56,464
Rybas!

34
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:10,984
Welcome back, Princess.
I trust your ride was pleasant.

35
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:12,903
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

36
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:14,344
I am relieved.

37
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:17,144
Every time that golden beast
brings you back unspoiled

38
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:19,264
it saves my head from a spike.

39
00:04:20,624 --> 00:04:22,224
Syrax is growing quickly.

40
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,144
She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

41
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:26,184
That's almost large enough
to saddle two.

42
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:29,104
I believe I'm quite content
as a spectator, thank you.

43
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,024
Dohaeras.

44
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:36,503
Naejot!

45
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,184
Rhaenyra.

46
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,704
You know I don't like you
to go flying

47
00:06:05,784 --> 00:06:07,264
while I'm in this condition.

48
00:06:07,343 --> 00:06:09,743
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

49
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:14,424
- Your Grace.
- Good morrow, Alicent.

50
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,664
Did you sleep?

51
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,624
- I slept.
- How long?

52
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,864
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

53
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:23,104
Well, here you are,
surrounded by attendants

54
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,704
all focused on the babe.

55
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,304
Someone has to attend to you.

56
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:32,624
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

57
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:36,263
This discomfort
is how we serve the realm.

58
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:39,384
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

59
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,304
We have royal wombs, you and I.

60
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,104
The child bed is our battlefield.

61
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:52,424
We must learn to face it
with a stiff lip.

62
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,824
Now take a bath.

63
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:57,824
You stink of dragon.

64
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,479
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe

65
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:03,464
you might be looking up
the wrong end."

66
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:08,584
My lords.

67
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:10,200
The growing alliance
among the Free Cities

68
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:13,424
has taken to styling itself
the Triarchy.

69
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,624
They have massed on Bloodstone

70
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:17,280
and are presently
ridding the Step stones

71
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,744
of its pirate infestation.

72
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,344
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

73
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:23,384
A man called Craghas Drahar

74
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:26,304
has styled himself the prince-admiral
of this Triarchy.

75
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,184
They call him the Crabfeeder

76
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,624
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

77
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,064
And are we meant to weep
for dead pirates?

78
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,104
- No, Your Grace.
- Rhaenyra, you're late.

79
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:39,824
The King's cupbearer
must not be late.

80
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:42,664
- Leaves people wanting for cups.
- I was visiting Mother.

81
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:46,464
On dragon back?

82
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:49,304
Hey, Your Grace,
at Prince Daemon's urging

83
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:51,824
the crown has invested
significant capital

84
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:55,223
in the re-training and re-equipping
of his City Watch.

85
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:59,344
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

86
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,104
and provide an assessment
of his progress

87
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:04,144
as commander of the Watch.

88
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:06,584
Do you think Daemon
is distracted by his present tasks?

89
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,704
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

90
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,903
Well, one would hope so,
considering the associated costs.

91
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:15,104
Then let us all consider your gold
well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

92
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:18,144
I would urge that you not allow
this Triarchy much latitude

93
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:19,784
in the Step stones, Your Grace.

94
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:23,344
If those shipping lanes should fall,
it will beggar our ports.

95
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:26,064
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys

96
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,064
and takes it under advisement.

97
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:36,824
Shall we discuss
the Heir's Tournament, Your Grace?

98
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:39,304
I would be delighted.

99
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,359
Will the maesters' name day
prediction hold, Mellos?

100
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:44,824
You must understand that these things
are mere estimations, my King

101
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:48,144
but we have all been
poring over the moon charts

102
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,824
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

103
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:54,503
The cost of the tournament
is not negligible.

104
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:58,824
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

105
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,183
Most of the lords and knights

106
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:02,000
are certainly on their way to
King's Landing already.

107
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,239
- To turn them back now...
- The tourney will take

108
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:04,663
the better part of a week.

109
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,584
Before the games are over,
my son will be born

110
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:09,224
and the whole realm will celebrate.

111
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:12,343
We have no way of predicting
the sex of the child.

112
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,984
Of course, no maester's capable
of rendering an opinion

113
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,503
free of conditions, are they now?

114
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,584
There's a boy in the Queen's belly.

115
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:21,424
I know it.

116
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,503
And my heir will soon put all of this

117
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,704
damnable hand-wringing
to rest himself.

118
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,104
He passed through
the Red Keep's gates at first light.

119
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:33,784
Does my father know he's here?

120
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,184
- No.
- Good.

121
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,584
Gods be good.

122
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:46,424
It's all right, ser.

123
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:08,504
Aye.

124
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,264
I bought you something.

125
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:45,864
Do you know what it is?

126
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,784
It's Valyrian steel.

127
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:51,584
Like Dark Sister.

128
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,304
Turn around.

129
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,304
Now

130
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:16,104
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

131
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:28,504
- Did you read it?
- Of course, I read it.

132
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,824
When Princess Nymeria
arrived in Dorne

133
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:32,624
who did she take to husband?

134
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:34,024
A man.

135
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:35,544
What was his name?

136
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,064
Lord Something.

137
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:40,704
If you answer with "Lord Something,"
Septa Marlow will be furious.

138
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,744
She's funny when she's furious.

139
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,104
You're always like this
when you're worried.

140
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,623
Like what?

141
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:51,104
Disagreeable.

142
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:57,104
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

143
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,384
with a son.

144
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:00,183
I only worry for my mother.

145
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,504
I hope for my father
that he gets a son.

146
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,703
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

147
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:09,344
You want him to have a son?

148
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,544
I want to fly with you on dragon back

149
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,199
see the great wonders
across the Narrow Sea

150
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,424
and eat only cake.

151
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:16,864
- I'm being serious.
- I never jest about cake.

152
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,064
You aren't worried about
your position?

153
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,904
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

154
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:26,584
Where are you going?

155
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,064
Home. The hour has grown late.

156
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:33,704
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

157
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,744
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

158
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,784
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

159
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,664
and burned her own fleet off Sun spear

160
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:43,224
to show her people
that they were finished running.

161
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:46,824
- What are you doing?
- So you remember.

162
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:50,944
- If the Septa sees this book then...
- Fuck the Septa.

163
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,383
Rhaenyra!

164
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,904
Is it healing?

165
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,784
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

166
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,784
Can you say yet what it is?

167
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,024
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

168
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,144
They are searching the texts
for similar cases.

169
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:19,584
It's a small cut
from sitting the throne.

170
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:21,024
It's nothing.

171
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,383
The King has been
under heavy stresses

172
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,183
preparing for the birth.

173
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:30,384
Bad humors of the mind
can adversely affect the body.

174
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:33,584
Whatever it is,
it needs to be kept quiet.

175
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:38,384
We should leech it again, maester.

176
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:41,104
It's a wound that refuses to heal,
Grand Maester.

177
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,904
Might I suggest cauterization?

178
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:47,984
Cauterization would be a wise
course of treatment, Your Grace.

179
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:49,864
- It will be painful...
- Fine.

180
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,464
Fine.

181
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,224
You spend more time in that bath
than I do on the throne.

182
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,744
This is the only place
I can find comfort these days.

183
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,064
It's tepid.

184
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:17,824
It's as warm
as the maesters will allow.

185
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:19,944
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

186
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,583
After this miserable pregnancy

187
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,144
I wouldn't be surprised
if I hatched an actual dragon.

188
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,624
And he will be loved and cherished.

189
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,584
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

190
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,824
Really?

191
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:38,024
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

192
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,184
Visenya.

193
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,159
She chose a dragon's egg
for the cradle

194
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:43,904
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

195
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,384
Gods be good.

196
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,704
This family already has its Visenya.

197
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:52,304
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

198
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:55,063
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

199
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:58,144
I'm sure he will reemerge
for the tourney.

200
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,144
He could never
stay away from the lists.

201
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:02,504
The tourney

202
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,584
to celebrate the firstborn son
that we presently do not have.

203
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,544
You do understand

204
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,384
nothing will cause the babe
to grow a cock

205
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,423
if it does not already possess one?

206
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,584
This child is a boy, Aemma.

207
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:16,823
I'm certain of it.

208
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,744
I've never been
more certain of anything.

209
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,504
The dream.

210
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,384
It was clearer than a memory.

211
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,050
Our son was born
wearing Aegon's iron crown.

212
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,330
When I heard the sound
of thundering hooves

213
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,490
splintering shields,
and ringing swords

214
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,210
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne

215
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,250
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled
and all the dragons roared as one.

216
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,689
Born wearing a crown?

217
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,690
Gods spare me,
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

218
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:10,730
This is the last time, Viserys.

219
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,210
I've lost one babe in the cradle,
had two stillbirths

220
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,490
and two pregnancies
ended well before their term.

221
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:24,569
That's five in twice as many years.

222
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,050
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir

223
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,490
and I'm sorry
if I have failed you in that.

224
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,770
I am.

225
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,890
But I've mourned
all the dead children I can.

226
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,210
Commander on the floor!

227
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,090
When I took command of the Watch,
you were stray mongrels

228
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,610
starving and undisciplined.

229
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,770
Now, you're a pack of hounds.

230
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,770
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

231
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,010
My brother's city
has fallen into squalor.

232
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,730
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

233
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:36,769
No longer.

234
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,850
Beginning tonight

235
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,810
King's Landing will learn
to fear the color gold.

236
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:26,570
Get up!

237
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,730
Raper!

238
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,050
No! No... no!

239
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,770
Thief!

240
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,090
No!

241
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,970
Murderer!

242
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,090
It was an unprecedented
roundup of criminals of every ilk.

243
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,010
Your brother
made a public show of it

244
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,890
meting out the summary
judgments himself.

245
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,050
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart

246
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,170
to haul away the resulting
dismemberments when it was done.

247
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,250
Gods be good.

248
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,290
The Prince cannot be allowed to act
with this kind of unchecked impunity.

249
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,250
- Brother.
- Daemon.

250
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,849
Carry on. You were saying
something about my impunity.

251
00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:00,569
You are to explain your doings
with the City Watch.

252
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,210
Your new gold cloaks

253
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,225
made quite the impression
last night, didn't they?

254
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:07,249
Did they?

255
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:10,410
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

256
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,369
They're an extension of the crown.

257
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:14,330
The Watch was enforcing
the crown's laws.

258
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,090
Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

259
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,530
My Prince, I don't think...

260
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,090
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

261
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,890
is hardly in line with our laws.

262
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:24,569
Nobles from every corner of the realm

263
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,530
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

264
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,930
for my brother's tourney.

265
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,529
Do you want them mugged,
raped, murdered?

266
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,330
You mightn't know this unless
you left the safety of the Red Keep

267
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,730
but much of King's Landing
is seen by the smallfolk

268
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,490
as lawless and terrifying.

269
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,970
Our city should be safe
for all its people.

270
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,810
I agree.

271
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,890
I just hope you don't have to maim
half of my city to achieve this.

272
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:50,730
Time will tell.

273
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,130
We installed Prince Daemon
as commander

274
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,970
to promote law and order.

275
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,409
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

276
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,129
Thank you for your support,
Lord Corlys.

277
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,906
If only the Prince would show
the same devotion

278
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,810
to his lady wife as he does
his work, Your Grace.

279
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,450
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

280
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,729
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

281
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,450
Lady Rhea is your wife.

282
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:15,490
A good and honorable
lady of the Vale.

283
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,370
In the Vale, men are said
to fuck sheep instead of women.

284
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:20,690
I can assure you,
the sheep are prettier.

285
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:21,769
Dear me.

286
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,490
You made a vow before the Seven
to honor your wife in marriage.

287
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,050
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea
to you, Lord High tower

288
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,890
if you're in want of a woman
to warm your bed.

289
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,530
Your own lady wife passed recently.

290
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,890
Did she not?

291
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,329
Otto.

292
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,729
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

293
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,410
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

294
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,370
Must you indulge him?

295
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:54,129
My apologies, Your Grace.

296
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,130
This council has, at great expense

297
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,850
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

298
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,610
Enforce my laws, but understand

299
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:06,729
any further performances
like last night's will be answered.

300
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,930
Understood, Your Grace.

301
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,810
King's Landing has been in decline
since my grandmother passed.

302
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:29,849
In the end

303
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,530
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

304
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,290
What troubles you, my Prince?

305
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,770
I could bring in another.

306
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,049
Perhaps a maiden.

307
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,370
I have several.

308
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,770
I could even arrange one
with silver hair.

309
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,130
You are Daemon Targaryen.

310
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,730
Rider of Caraxes.
Wielder of Dark Sister.

311
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,690
The King cannot replace you.

312
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:05,529
Be welcome!

313
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,770
I know many of you
have traveled long leagues

314
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,490
to be at these games

315
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,170
but I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

316
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,370
When I look at the fine knights
in these lists

317
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:22,010
I see a group without equal
in our histories.

318
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,130
And this great day
has been made more auspicious

319
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,010
by the news that I am happy to share.

320
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,729
Queen Aemma has begun her labors!

321
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,529
May the luck of the Seven
shine upon all combatants!

322
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,730
A mystery knight?

323
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,970
No, a Cole, of the Storm lands.

324
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,290
I've never heard of House Cole.

325
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,970
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

326
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,970
I would humbly ask for the favor of
The Queen Who Never Was.

327
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,690
Good fortune to you, cousin.

328
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,210
I would gladly take it
if I thought I needed it.

329
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,250
You could have
Baratheon's tongue for that.

330
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,290
Tongues will not change
the succession.

331
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,890
Let them wag.

332
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:56,690
Lord Stokeworth's daughter

333
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:58,289
is promised
to that young Tarly squire.

334
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:00,009
Lord Massey's son?

335
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,450
They're to be married
as soon as he wins his knighthood.

336
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,170
Best get on with it.

337
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,410
I heard that Lady Elinor

338
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,650
is hiding a swollen belly
beneath her dress.

339
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,891
What do you know about
this Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

340
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,370
I'm told Ser Criston is common-born,
son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

341
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:39,210
But other than that,
and the fact that he's just unhorsed

342
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,769
both of the Baratheon lads,
I really couldn't say.

343
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,890
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen!

344
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:09,130
Prince of the City will now choose
his first opponent!

345
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,050
For his first challenge,
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

346
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,370
Ser Gwayne High tower of Old town,
eldest son of the Hand of the King.

347
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,210
Five dragons on Daemon.

348
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,130
- Nicely done, Uncle.
- Thank you, Princess.

349
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,730
Now, I'm fairly certain
I can win these games, Lady Alicent.

350
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,970
Having your favor
would all but assure it.

351
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,130
Good luck, my Prince.

352
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:13,970
What's happening?

353
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,530
The infant is in breech, Your Grace.

354
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,170
All attempts to turn the babe
have failed.

355
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,210
Do something for her!

356
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,289
We've given her as much
milk of the poppy as we can

357
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,770
without risking the child.

358
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,450
Your Queen is a strong woman.

359
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,810
She's fighting with all her might,
but it may not be enough.

360
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,330
No!

361
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:32,770
Aemma.

362
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,970
Aemma, I'm here.

363
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,370
I'm here.

364
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,370
I'm here. It's all right.

365
00:30:40,449 --> 00:30:42,689
- It's all right.
- I don't wanna do this.

366
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,010
You're going to be all right.

367
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,330
Kill him!

368
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,770
And the day grows ugly.

369
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,249
I wonder if this is
how we should celebrate

370
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:21,330
the birth of our future king.

371
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:23,249
With wanton violence.

372
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,530
It's been 70 years
since King Maegor's end.

373
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,290
These knights are as green
as summer grass.

374
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,970
None have known real war.

375
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,746
Their lords sent them
to the tourney field

376
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,530
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed

377
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,810
and we expect them to act
with honor and grace.

378
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,850
It's a marvel that war
didn't break out at first blood.

379
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,770
Mellos.

380
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,170
Your Grace.

381
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:07,489
If you would.

382
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,730
During a difficult birth

383
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,890
it sometimes becomes necessary
for the father

384
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,770
to make an impossible choice.

385
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,610
Well, speak it.

386
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,770
To sacrifice one
or to lose them both.

387
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,170
There is a chance
that we can save the child.

388
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,170
A technique is taught at the Citadel

389
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,169
which involves cutting directly
into the womb

390
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,970
to free the infant.

391
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,050
- But the resulting blood loss...
- Seven Hells, Mellos.

392
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,810
You can save the child?

393
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,850
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

394
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:17,449
Ser Criston Cole will now tilt

395
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,690
against Ser Daemon Targaryen,
Prince of the City!

396
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,370
- Viserys.
- Yes?

397
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,490
They're going to bring
the babe out now.

398
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:00,289
I love you.

399
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,210
- What is happening?
- No, it's all right.

400
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,970
No, what is happening?

401
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,306
- Viserys, what...
- No, it's all right.

402
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,306
- What are you doing?
- They're going to bring the babe out.

403
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,490
How are they...

404
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,050
- It's all right.
- Viserys, please...

405
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,290
- It's all right.
- No, I'm scared.

406
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,826
- Don't be scared.
- What is happening?

407
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,465
Don't be scared.
They're going to bring the babe out.

408
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:28,050
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

409
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,850
They're going to bring the babe out.

410
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,650
No... no!

411
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,810
I'm making the first incision.

412
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,250
No... no!

413
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,130
Viserys, no! Please!

414
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,530
- No... no!
- Don't be scared.

415
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,690
Sword!

416
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,090
Prince Daemon Targaryen

417
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,650
wishes to continue
in a contest of arms!

418
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,610
Yield.

419
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,090
Yield.

420
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:36,769
Gods. He's Dornish.

421
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,370
I was hoping to ask
for the Princess's favor.

422
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,410
I wish you luck, Ser Criston.

423
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:54,889
Princess.

424
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,730
Congratulations, Your Grace.

425
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,810
You have a son.

426
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,050
It's a boy?

427
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,410
A new heir, Your Grace.

428
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,369
Had you and the Queen chosen a name?

429
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,970
Baelon.

430
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,250
They're waiting for you.

431
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,249
Dracarys.

432
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,490
- Where's Rhaenyra?
- Your Grace.

433
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,370
This is the last thing
any of us wish to discuss

434
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:26,530
at this dark hour,
but I consider the matter urgent.

435
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,850
What matter?

436
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:30,849
That of your succession.

437
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,690
These recent tragedies

438
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:34,529
have left you
without an obvious heir.

439
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,130
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

440
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,770
Despite how difficult this time is,
Your Grace

441
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,770
I feel it important
the succession be firmly in place

442
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,210
for the stability of the realm.

443
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:46,930
The succession is already set
by precedent and by law.

444
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:48,609
Shall we say his name?

445
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,450
Daemon Targaryen.

446
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:55,369
If Daemon were to remain
the uncontested heir

447
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,810
it could destabilize the realm.

448
00:42:57,889 --> 00:42:59,769
The realm? Or this council?

449
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,490
No one here can know
what Daemon would do were he king

450
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,250
but no one can doubt his ambition.

451
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,730
Look at what he did with
the gold cloaks.

452
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,770
The City Watch
is fiercely loyal to him.

453
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,450
- An army 2,000 strong.
- An army you gave him, Otto.

454
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:17,010
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

455
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,449
As Master of Coin

456
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,330
you said he was a spendthrift
that would beggar the realm.

457
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,090
Putting Daemon in command
of the City Watch was your solution!

458
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,090
A half-measure, Your Grace.

459
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,970
The truth is, Daemon should be
far away from this court.

460
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,970
Daemon is my brother.

461
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,450
My blood.

462
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,130
And he will have his place
at my court.

463
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:38,330
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace

464
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,330
but if the gods should visit
some further tragedy on you

465
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:45,330
- either by design or accident...
- "Design"?

466
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,249
What are you saying?

467
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,730
My brother would murder me,
take my crown?

468
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,410
Are you?

469
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,250
Please.

470
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,290
Daemon has ambition, yes,
but not for the throne.

471
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,210
He lacks the patience for it.

472
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:02,970
The gods have yet to make a man

473
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:06,369
who lacks the patience
for absolute power, Your Grace.

474
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:10,170
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

475
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,530
for the King to name a successor.

476
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,450
Well, who else would have a claim?

477
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,850
The King's firstborn child.

478
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,329
Rhaenyra? A girl?

479
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,610
No queen has ever
sat the Iron Throne.

480
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,706
That is only by tradition
and precedent, Lord Strong.

481
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,890
If order and stability
so concerns this council

482
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,890
then perhaps we shouldn't
break 100 years of it

483
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:36,649
by naming a girl heir.

484
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,250
Daemon would be
a second Maegor, or worse.

485
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:42,889
He is impulsive and violent.

486
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,770
It is the duty of this council

487
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,730
to protect the King
and the realm from him.

488
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,490
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
but that is the truth as I see it

489
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,930
and I know that others here agree.

490
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:56,810
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

491
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,610
You wouldn't have to, Your Grace.

492
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:01,010
There are others
who would have a claim.

493
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,650
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

494
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,970
- The Queen Who Never Was?
- Rhaenys was the only child

495
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:06,169
of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

496
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,170
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council

497
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,505
and she already has a male heir.

498
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:12,689
Just moments ago, you announced
your support for Daemon!

499
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,306
If we cannot agree on an heir,
then how can we expect...

500
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,370
My wife and son are dead!

501
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,050
I will not sit here and suffer crows
that come to feast on their corpses!

502
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,770
Send a raven to Old town.
Straight away.

503
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,090
My Lady.

504
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,450
My darling.

505
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,810
How's Rhaenyra?

506
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,050
She lost her mother.

507
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,570
The Queen was well-loved by all.

508
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:36,729
I found myself thinking
of your own mother today.

509
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:45,610
- How is His Grace?
- Very low.

510
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,930
Which is why I sent for you.

511
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,130
I thought you might go to him,
offer him comfort.

512
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,850
In his chambers?

513
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,090
I wouldn't know what to say.

514
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,250
Stop that.

515
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,610
He'll be glad of a visitor.

516
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,930
You might wear
one of your mother's dresses.

517
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,610
The Lady Alicent High tower,
Your Grace.

518
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,010
What is it, Alicent?

519
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,290
I thought I might come
and look in on you, Your Grace.

520
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,369
I brought a book.

521
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,570
That's very kind, thank you.

522
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:26,770
It's a favorite of mine.

523
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,890
I do know how passionate you are
for the histories.

524
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:33,330
Yes, I am.

525
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,530
When my mother died

526
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,450
people only ever
spoke to me in riddles.

527
00:48:57,249 --> 00:48:59,266
All I wanted was for someone
to say that they were sorry

528
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,930
for what happened to me.

529
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,610
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

530
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,690
Thank you.

531
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,930
The King's sole heir once again.

532
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,730
Might we drink to our future?

533
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:05,369
Quiet!

534
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:08,370
Your Prince will speak!

535
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,410
Silence!

536
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,530
Before we begin, Your Grace

537
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,770
I have a report
I feel compelled to share.

538
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,610
Last night

539
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:31,089
Prince Daemon bought out
one of the pleasure houses

540
00:50:31,169 --> 00:50:32,810
on the Street of Silk

541
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,690
to entertain officers
of the City Watch

542
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,570
and other friends of his.

543
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:44,010
King and Council
have long rued my position

544
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,250
as next in line for the throne.

545
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:52,810
But dream and pray as they all might,
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

546
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,530
The gods give
just as the gods take away.

547
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,490
He toasted Prince Baelon.

548
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,050
To the King's son.

549
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,410
Styling him...

550
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,770
the Heir for a Day.

551
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:17,210
I corroborated this report
with three separate witnesses.

552
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,490
The evening was,
by all accounts, a celebration.

553
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:26,250
You cut the image
of the conqueror, brother.

554
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:28,769
Did you say it?

555
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,410
I don't know what you mean.

556
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,930
You will address me as "Your Grace"

557
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:36,929
or I will have my Kings guard
cut out your tongue.

558
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:44,810
"The Heir for a Day."
Did you say it?

559
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,650
We must all mourn
in our own way, Your Grace.

560
00:51:57,929 --> 00:52:01,129
My family has just been destroyed.

561
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,090
But instead of being
by my side, or Rhaenyra's

562
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,850
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

563
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:11,010
Laughing with your whores
and your lickspittles!

564
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,050
You have no allies at court but me!

565
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,730
I have only ever defended you!

566
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,210
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

567
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:23,169
You've only ever
tried to send me away.

568
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,650
To the Vale, to the City Watch,
anywhere but by your side.

569
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,650
Ten years you've been king

570
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,730
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

571
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:35,769
- Why would I do that?
- Because I'm your brother.

572
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,610
And the blood of the dragon
runs thick.

573
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,770
Then why do you cut me so deeply?

574
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,610
I've only ever spoken the truth.
I see Otto High tower for what he is.

575
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,530
- An unwavering and loyal Hand?
- A cunt.

576
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,530
A second son
who stands to inherit nothing

577
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,850
he doesn't seize for himself.

578
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:54,089
Otto High tower
is a more honorable man

579
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:56,169
- than you could ever be.
- He doesn't protect you.

580
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,970
- I would.
- From what?

581
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,449
Yourself.

582
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:05,329
You're weak, Viserys.

583
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,426
And that council of leeches knows it.

584
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,730
They all prey on you
for their own ends.

585
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,290
I have decided to name a new heir.

586
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:20,890
- I'm your heir.
- Not anymore.

587
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:25,449
You are to return to Runestone
and your lady wife at once

588
00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:30,530
and you are to do so without quarrel
by order of your King.

589
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,570
Your Grace.

590
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:44,530
Father.

591
00:54:48,529 --> 00:54:50,290
Balerion was the last living creature

592
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,890
to have seen Old Valyria
before the Doom.

593
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:57,450
Its greatness and its flaws.

594
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:00,169
When you look at the dragons,
what do you see?

595
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:01,770
What?

596
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,610
You haven't spoken a word to me
since Mother's funeral

597
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,185
and now you send
your Kings guard down...

598
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:07,730
Answer me.

599
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:11,449
It's important.

600
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,370
What do you see?

601
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,490
- I suppose I see us.
- Tell me.

602
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:28,130
Everyone says Targaryens
are closer to gods than to men

603
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,810
but they say that
because of our dragons.

604
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,650
Without them,
we're just like everyone else.

605
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:42,330
The idea that we control
the dragons is an illusion.

606
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,130
They're a power
man should never have trifled with.

607
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:50,610
One that brought Valyria its doom.

608
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:54,129
If we don't mind our own histories,
it will do the same to us.

609
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,450
Targaryen must understand this
to be King...

610
00:55:58,650 --> 00:55:59,890
or Queen.

611
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,729
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

612
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:09,290
I have wasted the years
since you were born

613
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,970
wanting for a son.

614
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:24,369
You are the very best of your mother.

615
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,570
And I believe it, I know she did

616
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,010
that you could be
a great ruling queen.

617
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,650
Daemon is your heir.

618
00:56:35,009 --> 00:56:37,529
Daemon was not made
to wear the crown.

619
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,610
But I believe that you were.

620
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,450
Corlys of House Velaryon

621
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:47,490
Lord of the Tides
and Master of Driftmark.

622
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,650
I, Corlys Velaryon

623
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,690
Lord of the Tides
and Master of Driftmark

624
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,690
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

625
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,650
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

626
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:00,690
I pledge fealty to them

627
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,890
and shall defend them
against all enemies

628
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:05,290
in good faith and without deceit.

629
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,570
I swear this by the old gods
and the new.

630
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,610
This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.

631
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,690
A dragon's saddle is one thing

632
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,810
but the Iron Throne is the most
dangerous seat in the realm.

633
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,530
I, Lord Hobert High tower

634
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,850
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel

635
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:29,369
and Voice of Old town

636
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:32,050
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys

637
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,130
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

638
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,330
I pledge fealty to them

639
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,290
and shall defend them
against all enemies

640
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:43,970
in good faith and without deceit.

641
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,530
I swear this by the old gods
and the new.

642
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:55,650
Give me your hand.

643
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,570
I, Boremund Baratheon

644
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:15,930
promise to be faithful
to King Viserys.

645
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,210
There's something else
that I need to tell you.

646
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,249
It might be difficult
for you to understand

647
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,050
but you must hear it.

648
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,370
Our histories

649
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,370
they tell us that Aegon looked across
the Blackwater from Dragons tone

650
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:32,930
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

651
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,210
But ambition alone is not
what drove him to conquest.

652
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,490
It was a dream.

653
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,209
And just as Daenys foresaw
the end of Valyria

654
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:44,970
Aegon foresaw
the end of the world of men.

655
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,530
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter
gusting out of the distant north.

656
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,810
I, Rick on Stark,
Lord of Winter fell...

657
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,170
Aegon saw absolute darkness
riding on those winds.

658
00:58:57,249 --> 00:59:00,849
And whatever dwells within
will destroy the world of the living.

659
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:04,410
When this Great Winter comes,
Rhaenyra

660
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:06,929
all of Westeros
must stand against it.

661
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:08,546
And if the world of men
is to survive

662
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:11,130
a Targaryen must be seated
on the Iron Throne.

663
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,089
A king or queen

664
00:59:13,169 --> 00:59:16,810
strong enough to unite the realm
against the cold and the dark.

665
00:59:19,129 --> 00:59:21,970
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

666
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,770
This secret

667
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:29,489
it's been passed from king to heir
since Aegon's time.

668
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,290
Now you must promise to carry it

669
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:35,369
and protect it.

670
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,850
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

671
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,490
Promise me.

672
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:56,250
I, Viserys Targaryen,
first of his name

673
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,330
King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,
and the First Men

674
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:06,090
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm

675
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,490
do hereby name

676
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:11,209
Rhaenyra Targaryen

677
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,490
Princess of Dragons tone

678
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,010
and heir to the Iron Throne.
